My new repository
Hi, I'm Lerato and was a student at TUT studying Information Technology in Support Services field. At first I didn't understand what IT was all about until I fell in love with it and ended up being appointed as a Technical Programming Tutor in the final semester of my studies. I am eager to learn and I'm a very focused individual, I am now a bootcamper at Umuzi and  hoping to expand my skills and learn beyond my knowledge in IT.
